# CSe2018B_Exam_1sty_Grp2
Exam project for 2nd semester at Business Academy Southwest in cooperation with Belman A/S.

### Problem statement from Belman A/S :

We require an application which will be able to display the current progress of our production orders. The application will primarily be used as display which updates throughout the day with relevant orders to the current time.

We would like to see the following data on the screen for each order:

  * Order number – This can be presented as (01505001 or 015-050-01)
  * Delivery date – Should only display the date not time of the day.
  * Customer
  * Department
  * Estimated progress
  * Realized progress in relation to finished assignments on the order.
  * Overview of other departments and their progress.
  * The worker(s) currently active on the order or the last sign into it.
  
The application should be able to present multiple orders looking like postIt's or similar structure. Each order must be presented on the screen at the point in time where the estimated start date is reached for the given department. The order must stay on the screen until the given department has finished their assignments of the order.
